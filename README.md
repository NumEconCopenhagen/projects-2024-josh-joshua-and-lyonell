This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from the **Berau of Economic Analysis** on **Employment, Population, disposable income and the social goverment contribution per state** to get a first intuition if a change in the legal drinking age might have an effect on the employment rate.
3. Model project. Our model project investigates the effect of imbalances in power levels of household members on labour supply choices, using a dynamic unitary lifecycle model, which we solve and simulate numerically.
