# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).
The utility and demand functuions as well as the market clearing condition can be found in [ExchangeEconomy.py](ExchangeEconomy.py). 


The project focuses on solving an exchange economy using the Edgeworth Model. In questions 1 to 3, market allocations were computed based on a predefined endowment and a set of prices. From question 3 to 6, the maximization problem of the economy was addressed. These questions varied in terms of assumptions about the price vector and whether the maximization occurred under laissez-faire conditions or by a social planner. In questions 7 to 8, the endowment was made flexible by defining it to be drawn from a uniform distribution

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
