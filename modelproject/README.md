# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The role of bargaining power on household labour market behaviour**. Our project investigates the effect of imbalances in power levels of household members on labour supply choices, using a dynamic unitary lifecycle model, which we solve and simulate numerically. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running (DynamicHouseholdLabor.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** This project requires Anaconda Python 3 installation, the consav package and the econmodel package.
